# Red Dragon AI's Deep Learning Developer Course

## About the course

The Deep Learning Developer Course is built to take us from being a standard programmer to being able to add the Deep Learning Engineering skill set to our repertoire and CV. It goes beyond just theory and focuses on giving you the real world skills needed to prepare you for the position of being a key first hire for any company looking to develop an AI team, whether that be a start-up, SME or MNC.

## Projects

This repo contains the solutions for the coursework in the form of Jupyter Notebooks and codes for:
- Foundation projects that are assigned in the program.
- 2 personal projects that relate to our work (or outside interests).

The goal behind the personal projects is that:

1. we get to apply what we are learning to real world projects that can help the companies we work for; and
2. it allows us to create a portfolio of original work that sets us apart from other job candidates in the market, which is crucial in demonstrating our skill set to future employers.
